# Yining Han:
1. Sample link I know for now that gives a thumbnail of pictures. 
   http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/tools/chart/list.aspx
2. This should be the tool we use to do massive online batch query to our own
   Database. http://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/
3. Things I am trying to find out:
   a. what is the corresponding unique id for each galaxy.
   b. there is a query database limit 500MB, this should be a later concern.
