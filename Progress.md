1. Sample link I know for now that gives a thumbnail of pictures. 
   http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/tools/chart/list.aspx
   
2. This should be the tool we use to do massive online batch query to our own
   Database. http://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/
   
3. The guide on how to access the data base in batch mode:
   http://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/Guide.aspx
   Check out this:
   The data base do have a nice documentation. (you will need to register)
   http://www.voservices.net/skyquery/Apps/Schema/
   
4. Things I am trying to find out:
   a. what is the corresponding unique id for each galaxy.
   b. there is a query database limit 500MB, this should be a later concern.
